	<p><strong>If you won $1 million, what's the first thing you would buy? Why?</strong></p>
		<p>If I won a million dollars, I would buy a studio apartment in New York City, along with a ton of art supplies. Then I would have a private space to create freely.</p>
	
	<p><strong>If you could live anywhere in the world, where would it be? Why?</strong></p>
		<p>If I could live anywhere in the world, I would want to live in the Oia Village in Santorini, Greece. I'm fascinated by Greek history and art, and it's beautiful there.</p>
